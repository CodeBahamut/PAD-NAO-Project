# PAD-NAO-Project

In this project we used a NAO-robot to create an assistant for elderly in retirement homes. It is able to text to speech a certain set of cooking recepies, dance, play music and more.

This project was done in a agile team enviroment hence why its called PAD project (project agile development).
